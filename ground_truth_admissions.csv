We have to com ply with a variety o f regulations, and we are subject to random, scheduled and com plaint-driven audits and reviews as well.

However, if you are not clear about your overtim e eligibility status, im m ediately talk to your supervisor. If you are eligible fo r overtime, you need to understand the specific expectations o f your w ork area relating to overtime. For example, most supervisors require approval prior to any UF employee working overtime.

The View Paycheck & Leave Balances Instruction Guide provides additional inform ation on navigating to and reading your paystub.\n\nOvertime Eligibility\n\nSome employees are entitled to overtime and some are not. Determining your overtime eligibility depends on the application o f a federal law called the Fair Labor Standards A ct (FLSA).

Overtime is defined as w ork perform ed beyond 40 hours w ithin one workweek. Use o f paid leave, such as vacation or sick time, is not included in the calculation. Cash payment fo r purposes o f overtim e compensation is on the basis o f one and one-half times (1.5x) an employee’s regular hourly rate o f pay fo r each hour o f overtime worked w ithin one workweek. If the employee agrees to accrue overtime compensatory leave as an alternative to payment, the leave is also accrued at 1.5 hours o f leave fo r each hour worked.\n\nCompensatory Leave\n\nNon-exempt TEAMS and USPS employees are eligible to earn com pensatory leave in certain situations. Upon reasonable notice, supervisors or other appropriate UF administrators may require employees to use any part o f accrued overtime, special, or regular com pensatory leave at any tim e deemed advisable. Employees who have accrued compensatory leave may be required to use such leave before using vacation leave.\n\nThere are three types o f compensatory leave: overtim e com pensatory leave, regular compensatory leave, and special compensatory leave. The maximum accrual rate fo r both regular and overtim e com pensatory leave is 120 hours.\n\nRegular Compensatory Leave. Full-time\n\nexem pt USPS employees who are required to w ork more than 40 hours in a workweek are eligible to earn regular com pensatory leave. For every hour they w ork beyond 40 hours w ithin a workweek, they receive one hour o f com pensatory leave.

Non-exempt\n\n(i.e., hourly and overtim e eligible) USPS and TEAMS employees are either paid for overtim e w ork or are compensated with overtim e compensatory leave—if agreed upon by the employee and the departm ent\n\nSpecial Compensatory Leave.

If you are, you need to be tracking that time, as such tasks constitute w ork and you get paid fo r the w ork you do fo r UF.

Obviously, we hope this legal provision never applies to any UF employee, but it is im portant for you to be aware o f this reporting obligation.\n\nim m ediately report your injuries, so we can best respond to and address your injuries and also any hazards that may exist th a t could pose a continuing risk to others. If you are injured, you (or your supervisor, if you are unable) should im m ediately report the injury by calling 1-800-455-2079. Be sure your supervisor is aware of your injury. Visit the Workers’ Compensation website fo r the most up-to-date guidance on how to respond in the case o f a workplace injury.\n\nI f you use tobacco,\n\nTobacco-Free Campus\n\nplease be sure to read\n\nAnd another thing: No one wants to breathe second-hand smoke. (Do you know how dangerous that is?) In addition to having a drug-free workplace, we also have a tobacco- free university. (This includes, fo r example, indoor and outdoor properties as well as owned and leased property and vehicles.) UF’s Tobacco-Free Policy prohibits not just cigarettes, but also smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and pretty much any tobacco product you could inhale or spit out.\n\nth e e n tire\n\nT obaca\n\nFree C am pus p o lic y\n\nto be sure you\n\nun d e rsta n d th e details.\n\nI f you are try in g to quit,\n\nwe o ffe r em ployees\n\nresources to help.

Hazards should be proactively reported to your immediate supervisor or to EH&S.

If you get h u rt on the job, we w ant to be sure you are\n\nS afety in the Workplace\n\nokay. We also don’t w ant anyone else to get hurt in the same way. Im m ediately report all on- the-job injuries by calling 1-800-455-2079.\n\nThe last thing we want is fo r you to be injured on the job. We w ant everyone to go home safely at the end o f every workday. Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) plays a critical role in helping establish and maintain a safe w ork environment. The list o f programs EH&S manages is long, but here are just a few: biological safety, building codes, fire safety, industrial hygiene, lab safety, occupational safety, pest management, and radiation control.\n\nUnfortunately, accidents can happen. If something happens to you, you should\n\nThe Bottom Line on Safety\n\nTalking to your immediate supervisor is always a great first option fo r sharing a concern about safety, but there are other options available as well: Non-emergency concerns about possible threats o f violence can go directly to UFPD and concerns about a workplace hazard can be directly reported to EH&S. Another reporting option is to contact UFHR Employee Relations at (352) 392-1072 or EmploveeRelations(a)hr.ufl', ' to the\n\nTEAMS/USPS Em ployee H a n d b o o k (2019) 4 4\n\nnature o f the specific w ork to be done. Perhaps it is fo r a certain project, and once the project is completed, there is no longer a need for the position. Or, it is possible the funding fo r the position is tied to a limited source like a grant: once the grant is gone, the position is gone.\n\nAn employee appointed to fill a full- or part- tim e contract, grant, or auxiliary position that has been designated as a tim e-lim ited appointm ent will receive a 45-calendar-day notice o f the position ending and will not have layoff rights. You will know if your position is tim e-lim ited because it will be very clear in the position posting and the initial offer letter you receive.\n\nJob Abandonment\n\nUSPS or TEAMS employees who are absent w itho u t authorization fo r three or more consecutive workdays w itho u t contacting their supervisors may be considered to have abandoned their positions. If you cannot w ork fo r any reason, you (or someone on your behalf) must contact your supervisor to explain the situation and determ ine w hat type o f leave makes sense, given your situation. Please do not accidentally or inadvertently abandon your job.\n\nVoluntary Resignation or Retirements\n\nWe hope your em ploym ent with UF is positive and lasting. Should you plan to voluntarily resign from your position, to leave UF in good standing, you must provide your departm ent w ith one month’s notice if you are in an exempt position and at least two weeks’ notice if you are in a non-exem pt position.\n\nRe-Applying to UF\n\nIn most cases, if you resign in good standing, are laid off, or are separated due to the\n\n4 5\n\nTEAMS/USPS E m ployee H a n d b o o k (2019)\n\nexpiration o f a tim e-lim ited appointm ent, you do not have a waiting period to reapply fo r UF employment. You can reapply whenever you would like to and are eligible fo r rehire. In other words: Go fo r it! However, anyone who leaves under not-so-good circumstances may not be im m ediately eligible fo r rehire.\n\nEmployees who are unclear about their rehire eligibility may contact UFHR Recruitment and Staffing at (352) 392-2HRS (2477) or via email at em ploy ment(a)ufl.edu. Every situation is a little different, and we are willing to talk to you about your circumstances.\n\nOff-the-Job Conduct & Criminal Convictions\n\nMisconduct you engage in o ff-th e-clo ck could im pact your employment. For example, public drunkenness, driving under the influence, drug offenses, or conviction o f any crime other than m inor tra ffic violations may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. If you are involved in any type of criminal action, even if it is away from work, inform your supervisor if the m atter will interfere w ith your ability to do your job or may implicate UF in anyway.\n\nW hy is th is im p o rta n t? If your conduct, even off-the-clock, adversely affects your ability to perform your job, we w ant to know. For example, if a criminal procedure or conviction will result in you missing a lot o f work, your absences could im pact the w ork being done in your departm ent. If your actions cause you to lose the tru st and respect o f your colleagues, it can significantly im pact your ability to remain effective in your role. For most people, this will never be an issue, but it is im portant to be aware o f how conduct outside o f w ork could have a real im pact on the workplace.\n\nWelcome Aboard!\n\nWow. You read the whole Employee Handbook. Nice job. We hope this was both inform ative and helpful. Employees new to UF, please be sure to visit the Welcome to UF website for additional inform ation designed to help you settle in.\n\nAcknowledgment of Receipt of Employee Handbook\n\nWe wanted you to know th a t your supervisor may ask you to acknowledge receipt o f the Employee Handbook. And th a t’s perfectly reasonable.\n\nIf you read something in the Employee Handbook th a t doesn’t seem right to you, you should feel empowered to ask questions.

Graduates can contribute to the health of the local, national, and international communities through advancing public health knowledge and by designing, implementing, and evaluating programs and policies that prevent disease and promote health. Students have the opportunity to develop skills in 1 of 6 public health concentration areas:\n\nBiostatistics: Applying quantitative and analytical methods in public\n\nhealth research and evaluation\n\nEnvironmental health: Assessing risk levels and protecting the public\n\nfrom environmental threats to health\n\nEpidemiology: Studying the distribution and determinants of health In\n\npopulations and communities\n\nPublic health management and policy: Providing leadership in public health administration and developing policies to promote the public’s health\n\nPublic health practice: Developing breadth in the ﬁeld of public health\n\nby studying 2 or more of the other concentration areas\n', 'accalaureate work at the University of Florida. Credits transferred from other universities are applied toward the degree requirements, but grades earned are not computed in the student’s grade point average. Acceptance of transfer of credit requires approval of the student’s supervisory committee and the Dean of the Graduate School.\n\nAcademic units must submit petitions for transfer of credit for a master’s degree during the student’s ﬁrst term of enrollment in the Graduate School.\n\nThe supervisory committee is responsible for using established criteria to ensure the academic integrity of course work before accepting graduate transfer credits.\n\nSupervisory committee: The student’s supervisory committee must be appointed as soon as possible after the student is admitted to the Graduate School and no later than the second term of graduate study.\n\nSupervisory committees for graduate degree programs are initiated by the student, nominated by the respective academic unit chair, approved by the college dean, and appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. The Dean of the Graduate School is an ex-ofﬁcio member of all supervisory committees. Only Graduate Faculty may serve on a supervisory committee. If a student takes fewer than 12 credits in the ﬁrst term, the deadline is the end of the term during which the student has accumulated 12 or more credits or the end of the second term. If a minor is designated for any degree, a representative from that minor is needed on the supervisory committee. If two minors are designated, two representatives are needed.\n\nThe supervisory committee for a master’s degree with a thesis should consist of at least two Graduate Faculty members, unless otherwise speciﬁed. If a minor is designated, the committee must include a Graduate Faculty member from the minor department. See Supervisory Committees and Final Examinations for Master Level Degree Programs Policy (http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/media/graduate-school/pdf-ﬁles/ Policy-On-Final-Examinations-for-Master-Degree-Programs-Final.pdf) for guidance.\n\nFor a master’s degree without thesis, oversight is at the academic unit/department/college level only. Non-thesis programs may choose\n\nto have a formal committee or an alternate structure as determined by the program’s graduate faculty and consistent with academic unit policies. The oversight authority will be considered as the supervisory committee. Units are able to enter their internal information into GIMS as a convenience. Any student with a minor must have the name of the graduate faculty member overseeing the minor entered into GIMS.\n\nChanges to existing supervisory committee: A student, in consultation with their academic unit, may seek changes to an existing supervisory committee. Changes to a student’s committee are allowed until midpoint of the term of degree award if the defense has not occurred. No changes are allowed after the defense. For procedural details, contact the major academic unit.\n\nLanguage requirements:\n\n1. Each academic unit determines whether a reading knowledge of a foreign language is required. The requirement varies from one academic unit to another, and the student should check with the appropriate academic unit for speciﬁc information.\n\n2. All candidates must be able to use the English language correctly and\n\neffectively, as judged by the supervisory committee.\n\nExamination: Each candidate must pass a ﬁnal comprehensive examination. Some programs use different terminology, such as capstone course. This examination must cover at least the candidate’s ﬁeld of concentration. It must occur no earlier than the term before the degree is awarded.\n\nTime limitation: All work (including transferred credit) counted toward the master’s degree must be completed within 7 years before the degree is awarded.\n\nLeave of absence: Any student who will not register at UF for a period of more than 1 term needs prior written approval from the supervisory committee chair for a leave of absence for a designated period of time. This approval remains in the student’s departmental ﬁle. The Graduate School does not require notiﬁcation. The student must reapply for admission on return. See Readmission and Catalog Year.\n\nMaster’s thesis requirements: Each master’s thesis candidate must prepare and present a thesis that shows independent investigation. It must be acceptable, in form and content, to the supervisory committee and to the Graduate School. The work must be of publishable quality and must be in a form suitable for publication, guided by the Graduate School’s format requirements.
