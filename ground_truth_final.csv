16,How does establishing a new center or institute at University of Florida contribute to public service and what activities are planned for this purpose?,"[""UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA GUIDELINES - CENTERS AND INSTITUTES March 17, 2008\n\nI. Introduction\n\nCenters and Institutes focus on domains of knowledge that reside within a discipline or are cross- disciplinary in scope. These are organizational mechanisms that can be used to provide greater depth in teaching and/or research to a focal area within a discipline, or to apply a broader vision to problems that cross traditional knowledge boundaries. Centers may help develop new areas of research that enhance faculty development, encourage interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and research, provide relevant focus for service to external and internal constituencies, and/or promote sharing of resources (e.g., equipment, labs) and collaboration across departmental and college boundaries.\n\nII. Definitions\n\nInstitutes: With some exceptions, an institute is an umbrella organization providing administrative support for two or more academic units that are working on related subjects. Institutes provide an array of services to a broadly defined population. Centers: A college or university-wide unit that provides services to a specific population.\n\nIII. Types of Centers/Institutes\n\nCenters and Institutes are classified either as (1) State of Florida centers or institutes or (2) University of Florida (UF) centers and institutes.\n\n(1) State of Florida centers or institutes have a state-wide mission, and receive state funds. In some instances they are established as a result of Legislative intent. The State of Florida centers housed at UF are:\n\nUniversity Press of Florida\n\nFor information on the State of Florida centers and institutes refer to Board of Governors Regulation 10.015 (http://www.flbog.org/about/_doc/regulations/RegsChapter10.pdf)\n\n(2) University of Florida (UF) centers and institutes have a University-wide mission. UF centers and institutes may receive state funds based on the discretion of the Dean of the college to whom they report.\n\nIV. Guidelines for Proposals to establish New Centers and Institutes\n\nIt is appropriate and desirable to create centers when the resources are available and when the establishment of a center is consistent with the long-range plans of a college and/or the University. The departments, colleges and the University should be selective in creating new centers.\n\nA. A University sanctioned center or institute is an extension of the University. It requires some degree of oversight to maintain mission concurrence within the organization. State of Florida Centers (receiving state funds) require Florida Board Of Education (FBOE) approval since state funds are expended by the Center.\n\nB. The center/institute should be closely tied to the research and educational mission and, when\n\npossible, to the strategic plan of UF (http://www.president.ufl.edu/workPlan.html). Proposals for new centers and institutes must facilitate the academic mission of UF by enhancing its teaching and research functions, fostering external fund raising, and/or facilitating interdisciplinary cooperation. These activities should be facilitated in ways that a current structure (department or college or existing center) cannot. In particular, UF expects that a proposal for a new center or institute will demonstrate how it will enhance UF’s mission in a manner not being accomplished by existing programs.\n\nThe proposal should be no more than 10 pages in length. Appendix material may be provided as specified. The following information should be included in the text of the proposal:\n\nC. Mission Statement and Goals: The mission of the center should be defined and the goals for research, teaching and public service explained. All three elements are not required for a center to be established but should be identified when they are anticipated to be part of the mission.\n\nD. Proposed Activities: Describe the activities that are planned for the center (e.g., collaborative research on the topic of (X); the intent to generate interdisciplinary resources, to design courses, to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program, attract postdoctoral fellows, create a lecture series; to establish a core service facility, provide greater focus and depth to a research area, etc.). Explain the plans to apply for external funding and identify the relationship of the center's activities with those of departments and/or other centers. Describe the advantages of the center over current structure (what unmet needs will be satisfied by having the center?) and the value of the center to the University and to the reporting unit. Describe, where possible, the synergistic and collaborative efforts existing amongst the members of the proposed center. Also describe their record in successfully garnering extramural funds.\n\nE. Reporting Structure: The proposal for a new center or institute must include a reporting structure and describe the logic of that structure at UF. In particular, the proposal should outline to whom and through whom the center or institute reports. The proposal should demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment and interest from""]","Establishing a new center or institute at University of Florida can contribute to public service by providing greater focus and depth to a research area, designing courses, developing interdisciplinary graduate programs, attracting postdoctoral fellows, creating a lecture series, establishing a core service facility, and providing external funding.
