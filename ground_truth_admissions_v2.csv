3, What important steps should student organizations take before traveling to create clear and complete emergency procedures?,"[' While no risk management plan is guaranteed, these techniques and considerations should help in the risk reduction and planning process for you and your group.\n\nIn general, students participating in University sponsored events or activities may consider themselves as an “invitee” under the law. As such, the school or sponsoring organization has a duty to exercise reasonable care to:\n\n1. Not injure invitees through negligent activities; 2. Warn invitees of hidden dangers; 3. 4. Take precautions to protect invitees from foreseeable dangers; 5. Provide assistance or care to injured invitees, and; 6. Create a written plan outlining the precautions that are being taken.\n\nInspect the premises and venues for possible hazardous conditions;\n\nSome resources that may prove helpful for you to consider when planning your events include:\n\n1. Student Legal Services 2. Youth Compliance Office (for events involving minors 17 or younger) 3. Environmental Health and Safety 4. University Police Department 5. Student Activities and Involvement 6. Office of Event Services\n\nINSURANCE\n\nTypically, vendors must carry insurance to be approved to provide their service on campus. Be sure when talking to vendors that they are properly insured and can provide their Certificate of Insurance (COI) to the Environmental Health and Safety office PRIOR to completing arrangements with them for your event.\n\nStudent organizations may be required to purchase additional insurance for the events and/or activities that it hosts on campus. Event insurance (also known as a TULIP policy) can provide financial protection should there be injury to attendees or volunteers, or damage to UF property during an event held on campus. This requirement may be determined by the university venue, Environmental Health and Safety office, through the event permitting process or encouraged by university advisors so the participants, your student organization and the University are protected and properly covered in case of an incident. Types of activities that may require additional insurance include but are not limited to concerts, mechanical amusement devices (inflatable novelties), motorized sporting events and boxing, wrestling, karate, or any event that has non-UF student participation. It is important that you do not misrepresent any aspect of the event or program on the permit request to avoid insurance requirements or to decrease liability exposure to ensure that the insurance company will not void its agreement with you.\n\nFor more information on TULIP and event insurance please visit the Event Liability Insurance website for UF’s Environmental Health and Safety office or contact SAI at sai@ufsa.ufl.edu.\n\nSTUDENT ORGANIZATION RESOURCE GUIDE | 25\n\nSECURITY\n\nStudent organizations that are hosting events must take adequate precautions for the security of attendees at an event, as determined by the University Police Department, in conjunction with Student Activities and Involvement and Office of Event Services.\n\nIn general, the required number and type of security personnel for an event will be determined based upon projected attendance, time and location of event, description of activity planned, and the number of organizational personnel available to help monitor the event. Final determination as to the appropriate number of security personnel will be made by the University Police. Other factors which may be determined are advertising, closed vs. open event, expected crowd size, money collection, nature of crowd or program, risk assessment, and written invitations or prior ticket sales.\n\nNOTE: Failure to adhere to these security policies may result in the cancellation of your event.\n\nMISREPRESENTATION/FRONTING\n\nStudent employees and student organizations shall not use their privileges for access to university space and services inappropriately. As an example, a student organization should never agree to reserve a meeting room for a department, non- university group, or commercial vendor who would not have access to campus or for whom there would be a fee charged. If a non-university group of any type contacts your student organization about “co-sponsorship” for access to space or service, please contact eventservices@union.ufl.edu.\n\n26 | STUDENT ORGANIZATION RESOURCE GUIDE\n\nTRAVEL AND YOUR ORGANIZATION\n\nStudent organizations often travel to conferences, tournaments, or plan day/field trips for their organization members and leaders. As we become more “liability conscious,” students should be aware of their liability in travelling as well as the various alternatives available.\n\nLeaders of all organizations that intend to travel should inform their advisor and take necessary precautions to mitigate risk and create emergency procedures that are clear and complete PRIOR to travel. This can include creating a traveler information form and report to share with a non-travelling member/advisor in case of emergencies that includes emergency contact information for each traveler, dietary restrictions, medical insurance information, notable medications, travel route, travel insurance information, car insurance information, hotel information, conference schedule, etc., Also, visit Student Legal Services, or for legal advice and your organization']","Student organizations that intend to travel should inform their advisor and take necessary precautions to mitigate risk and create clear and complete emergency procedures prior to travel.

The Student Organization Fairs held in the Fall, Spring, and Summer B are an excellent way to promote your organization. In order to retain your members, keep them stimulated through leadership opportunities, create long-term and short-term goals, and have retreats and opportunities to develop relationships and friendships.\n\nMEETING STRUCTURE: Your meetings should include an agenda with what you want to accomplish. This keeps the meeting organized and maintains a clear purpose. Provide an opportunity for your executive members to have input on what is discussed. For example, if an important event is coming up and the leader of that event would like a longer timeslot than usual, add that in your planned agenda.\n\nAs leader of an organization, be mindful and intentional in your decision-making process when it relates to your organization. Remember, serving as a leader is a responsibility that may require putting the interests of the team, organization or community above your own. Additionally, as a leader, you not only represent yourself, but everyone in your organization. An important first step is setting clear intentions and asking yourself “WHY?” Why are you choosing to do or not do something on behalf of the organization? If the outcome of your decision is not in the best interest of your organization, re-examine and consider other more favorable options that meet the goals and interest of the organization. With that in mind, perform your responsibilities motivated by the good of the whole group and not for your own self-interest. Using this philosophy, you will ensure that you and your organization meet the goals you set and achieve what you hope to accomplish.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT: Good leaders have trust in their executive team and members. Maximize the strengths of your team by delegating accordingly and keeping a fun, structured and inclusive culture. Your members will feel better connected to the organization and each other if given some autonomy. Set expectations early so each of your members can hold each other accountable for their responsibilities.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ETHICAL DECISION MAKING (ADAPTED FROM THE LEADERSHAPE INSTITUTE, CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS) The following is a framework offered to assist you in making ethical decisions. Understanding how ethical decisions are processed will help you make the best decisions for yourself and your organization.\n\nRELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR ADVISOR: An advisor is an integral part of every student organization. The role of the advisor is to advise and serve as a resource to the students and the student organization. Your advisor can help your organization develop by being the source of consistency from year to year. Don’t consider your advisor as only a signatory on forms, but rather an engaged resource whom you can utilize and rely upon when you need assistance with program planning or troubleshooting within', ' your organization.\n\n1. Begin with the desire to do the right thing 2. Clarify your options 3. Consider risks and benefits 4. Advance ethical values 5. Make a judgment 6. Implement to maximize benefits and minimize risks\n\n7. Monitor and modify Bottom Line Considerations:\n\nWho is left out or not considered in my decision?\n\nTRANSITION & LEGACY: Every organization goes through a transition period at the beginning and end of each year. To make the transition process run smoothly, it is recommended that you encourage your officers to maintain all their materials (electronically as well), provide feedback, and hold meetings with the new officers that will be taking over their positions. Transition reports document the officers’ legacy on the organization and provide a foundation for the new leaders.\n\nIs my action doing more good than harm? • Am I proud of this decision? • Would I be comfortable or embarrassed t his decision made news?\n\nSTUDENT ORGANIZATION RESOURCE GUIDE | 13\n\nETHICS CONT.\n\nETHICS WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION\n\n1. Keep an open communication line with all organization members. 2. Organization members should be clear as to what their role is, and what is expected of them, as well as what they might gain from participating in the organization.\n\n3. The president is not the organization’s boss, rather they ought to be looked upon as the spokesperson or facilitator of the group.\n\n4. Don’t ask an organization member to do something that you would not be willing to do yourself. 5. All roles should be rotated between organization members so that the members do not experience burnout, boredom, or dissension.\n\n6. “Fringe benefits” given to the organization, such as T-shirts, need to be distributed fairly. 7. Provide ample notice and time to when and where all organization meetings and events are being held. Post the time and locations on your organization’s dashboard within Gator Connect, as well as websites and social group pages. Have “phone trees” to remind members to come to the meetings.\n\n8. Treat all members equally, whether they are personal friends or someone you do not yet know. The organization is not only a social club. Hold your meetings in an organized and systematic manner with an agenda. Make sure you allow a period for all organization members to express their views and volunteer their time and talent. Meetings can be more interesting and productive if you start off with an ice breaker or something that is fun but not too time consuming. 9. When explaining how to do a task, think of yourself as a new member with no experience and try to explain the task clearly and allow for questions. If it’s too complex, ask to meet after the meeting for more explanation or involve all the members in learning the task.\n\n10. Encourage organization members to come to the office to complete their tasks, meet others, and talk to the advisor.\n\nETHICS AND OUTSIDE (NON-UF) ORGANIZATIONS\n\n1. You represent your organization and may appear to speak for the University of Florida, and the State of Florida to outside agencies, clients, and fellow students. The image you portray is very important.\n\n2. When you deal with outside organizations in an ethical manner, you will help all future organization members in their dealings with these agencies.\n\n3. Do not offer another organization’s services without first consulting that organization, officer and advisor. 4. If you are doing any publicity or promotion, follow all University policies and procedures. Refer to the appropriate sections of this handbook.\n\n5. Remember that everyone has a deadline for getting work done. Allow for plenty of time when turning in requests to all other departments, University departments, and outside agencies, as well as for your publicity planning and Tech requests. If another student organization contacts your organization about a possible co-sponsorship, be realistic about your interest, and tell them when you can meet to make a decision and give them an answer (with an explanation) as soon as possible. This will allow them to either get started or find another sponsor. 6.\n\n14 | STUDENT ORGANIZATION RESOURCE GUIDE\n\nREGULATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS\n\nEach registered student organization’s purposes and activities shall comply with applicable provisions of the United States Constitution, federal laws, the Constitution of the State of Florida, state laws, rules and regulations of the Board of Governors, the University of Florida Board of Trustees, University of Florida, and the University of Florida Student Conduct Code, and the purposes set forth in the Student Body Constitution, and the constitution of the Student organization.
