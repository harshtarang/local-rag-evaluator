The center may also enhance the University's reputation and attract external funding, which can benefit the entire institution.\n\nThe reporting structure and administrative structure of the center or institute should be clearly outlined in the proposal. The center should report to the relevant dean or vice president, depending on its scope and focus. The center should also have a director and an advisory committee to oversee its operations and ensure alignment with the University's mission and objectives.\n\nFinally, all members of the center, their academic affiliations, and areas of expertise should be listed in an appendix document.
