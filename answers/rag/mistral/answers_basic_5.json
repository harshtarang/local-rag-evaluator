        "Establishing a new center or institute at the University of Florida can contribute to public service in several ways. One of the primary ways is through the conduct of research in areas of public importance and the dissemination of knowledge gained from that research to the broader community. This can be achieved through collaborative research projects, seminars, and major conferences in the area of focus. The center or institute can also provide educational core or elective courses, fund graduate students, and offer core lab support for research of members. Additionally, the center or institute can mentor junior faculty, fund travel for students, and provide public programs and results of those programs.\n\nAnother way the new center or institute can contribute to public service is through fundraising accomplishments and exchanges, agreements, or planning initiatives. The center or institute can also aim to generate interdisciplinary resources, attract postdoctoral fellows, and create a lecture series. These activities can help address unmet needs and add value to the University that cannot be provided at the college, department, or division level.\n\nThe annual reports submitted by each UF Center/Institute to the Board of Governors will also be evaluated in the context of UF's mission of research, education, and service, and the strategic goals of the Florida Board of Governors. The evaluation will provide a brief critical review of the Center/Institute’s progress and an assessment of the return on investment of State dollars, if applicable. The Center/Institute should demonstrate how it adds value to the University that cannot be provided at the college, department, or division level.",

The format and information required for these reports are specified by the Deans of the respective colleges.     VI. Guidelines for Evaluation of Centers and Institutes     The University administration will evaluate Centers/Institutes on a cyclical basis.  The Provost and Vice President for Research will evaluate each State of Fl orida Center/Institute every three (3) years.  Deans will evaluate the University of Florida Centers/Institutes assigned to their respective colleges every five (5) years.

Proposed Activities: Describe the activities that are planned for the center (e.g., collaborative research on the topic of (X); the intent to generate interdisciplinary resources, to design courses, to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program, attract postdoctora l fellows, create a lecture series; to establish a core service facility, provide greater focus and depth to a r esearch area, etc.). Explain the plans to apply for external funding and identify the relationship of the center's activities with those of departments and/or other centers.

Describe, where possible, the synergistic and collaborative efforts existing amongst the members of the  proposed center.  Also describe their record in successfully garnering extramural funds.     E.   Reporting Structure: The proposal for a new cente r or institute must include a reporting structure and describe the logic of that structure at UF.  In particular, the proposal should outline to whom and through whom the center or institute reports.  The proposal s hould demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment and interest from relevant departments, colleges, or other stakeholders.     A new center or institute will in general, report to the dean of the college unless it is a campus-wide center or institute in which case it would report to th e relevant Vice President (Vice President Health Affairs, Vice President IFAS, Vice President for Research or the Provost ).  Any campus-wide centers should be discussed with the relevant vice president(s) prior to producing a proposal.  F.   Administrative structure: The position of the cente r/institute within the University/college/department must be explained with the lines of accountability and responsibility clearly indicated. Each center should design its own administrative structure in consultatio n with the relevant department chair(s) and dean.

Exceptions such as federal awards that require the naming of the activity as a \"Center\" should be discussed with the appropriate administrators.      J. Forms to apply for a center or institute can be obtained from the web at www.ir.ufl.edu/centers/guidelines.htm.       V. Guidelines for Submission of Annual Reports by Centers and Institutes:    The Office of Academic Affairs, the Vice President  for Research and the Florida Board of Governors require that all centers and institutes submit an annual activity report. When more than one university is affiliated with a center/institute, the host university is  responsible for submitting a comprehensive report.    A.  Annual Reporting requirements to the Florida BOG (for All Centers /Institutes)      An annual report (July 1 through June 30) is to be subm itted for each Center/Institute.  All reports are to be filed electronically through the Florida Board of Gove rnor’s (BOG’s) Expertnet system at the end of each calendar year for the previous fiscal year.

Additional Reporting Requirements for University of Florida Centers/Institutes   In addition to the information submitted through the Expe rtnet system to the BOG, UF Centers /Institutes are required to provide annual reports as required by the Dean  of the College to whom they report.  The format and information required for these reports are specified by the Deans of the respective colleges.     VI. Guidelines for Evaluation of Centers and Institutes     The University administration will evaluate Centers/Institutes on a cyclical basis.  The Provost and Vice President for Research will evaluate each State of Fl orida Center/Institute every three (3) years.  Deans will evaluate the University of Florida Centers/Institutes assigned to their respective colleges every five (5) years.      The submission DEADLINE for all evaluations will be approximately April 15 of each year.  The Office of Institutional Planning and Research maintain s the schedule of evaluations of all Centers and Institutes, and will coordinate the process with the r espective deans and the office of the Vice President for Research.  Completed evaluations should be uploaded to the evaluation web site http://www.ir.ufl.edu/oirapps/centersandinstitutes/. (Please note, this differs from the annual reporting coordinated by the Office of Institutional Planning and Research).       Evaluations will focus on the mission and stated objec tives of the Center/Institute.  The evaluator should consider the following items as they evaluate their i ndividual Centers/Institutes. Additional",
            "All three elemen ts are not required for a center to be established but should be identified when they are anticipated to be part of the mission.   D.  Proposed Activities: Describe the activities that are planned for the center (e.g., collaborative research on the topic of (X); the intent to generate interdisciplinary resources, to design courses, to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program, attract postdoctora l fellows, create a lecture series; to establish a core service facility, provide greater focus and depth to a r esearch area, etc.). Explain the plans to apply for external funding and identify the relationship of the center's activities with those of departments and/or other centers. Describe the advantages of the center over current structure (what unmet needs will be satisfied by having the center?) and the value of the center to the University and to the reporting unit. Describe, where possible, the synergistic and collaborative efforts existing amongst the members of the  proposed center.  Also describe their record in successfully garnering extramural funds.     E.   Reporting Structure: The proposal for a new cente r or institute must include a reporting structure and describe the logic of that structure at UF.  In particular, the proposal should outline to whom and through whom the center or institute reports.  The proposal s hould demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment and interest from relevant departments, colleges, or other stakeholders.     A new center or institute will in general, report to the dean of the college unless it is a campus-wide center or institute in which case it would report to th e relevant Vice President (Vice President Health Affairs, Vice President IFAS, Vice President for Research or the Provost ).  Any campus-wide centers should be discussed with the relevant vice president(s) prior to producing a proposal.  F.   Administrative structure: The position of the cente r/institute within the University/college/department must be explained with the lines of accountability and responsibility clearly indicated. Each center should design its own administrative structure in consultatio n with the relevant department chair(s) and dean. However, it is expected that each center/institute will have at a minimum, a director and an advisory committee.       4.
