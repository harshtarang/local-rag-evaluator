            "All three elemen ts are not required for a center to be established but should be identified when they are anticipated to be part of the mission.   D.  Proposed Activities: Describe the activities that are planned for the center (e.g., collaborative research on the topic of (X); the intent to generate interdisciplinary resources, to design courses, to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program, attract postdoctora l fellows, create a lecture series; to establish a core service facility, provide greater focus and depth to a r esearch area, etc.). Explain the plans to apply for external funding and identify the relationship of the center's activities with those of departments and/or other centers. Describe the advantages of the center over current structure (what unmet needs will be satisfied by having the center?) and the value of the center to the University and to the reporting unit. Describe, where possible, the synergistic and collaborative efforts existing amongst the members of the  proposed center.  Also describe their record in successfully garnering extramural funds.     E.   Reporting Structure: The proposal for a new cente r or institute must include a reporting structure and describe the logic of that structure at UF.  In particular, the proposal should outline to whom and through whom the center or institute reports.  The proposal s hould demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment and interest from relevant departments, colleges, or other stakeholders.     A new center or institute will in general, report to the dean of the college unless it is a campus-wide center or institute in which case it would report to th e relevant Vice President (Vice President Health Affairs, Vice President IFAS, Vice President for Research or the Provost ).  Any campus-wide centers should be discussed with the relevant vice president(s) prior to producing a proposal.  F.   Administrative structure: The position of the cente r/institute within the University/college/department must be explained with the lines of accountability and responsibility clearly indicated. Each center should design its own administrative structure in consultatio n with the relevant department chair(s) and dean. However, it is expected that each center/institute will have at a minimum, a director and an advisory committee.       4. Center Membership All members of the center, their academic affiliations, and area(s) of expertise, should be listed in an appendix document.   G.   The",

Additional relevant items may be included.      • Funded/proposed teaching/training grants in area of focus  • Funded/proposed research project grants in area of focus • Investment of C/I funds in generating pilot data for grants  • Promoting and funding seminars with C/I funds (not customary dept seminars)  • Promoting and funding major conferences in area of focus  • Educational Core or Elective Courses offered in area of focus  • Funding graduate students from C/I funds  • Funding travel for students from C/I funds  • Providing core lab support for research of members  • Mentoring junior faculty  • Fundraising accomplishments  • Public programs and results of those programs  • National or international recognition received  • Exchanges, agreements or planning initiated  The evaluation should provide a brief critical review  and evaluation of the Center/Institute’s progress within the context of UF’s mission of research, educati on, and service; and where possible, to the strategic goals of the Florida Board of Governors (http://www.flbog.org/about/strategicplan/).  The review should  also include an assessment of the return on investment of State dollars, if applicable.  The Center/Institute should demonstrate how it adds value to the University  that cannot be provided at the college, department, or division level.    Annual reports submitted by each UF Center/Institute to  the Board of Governors (Section V.A) will also be used as a component of the evaluation. The most recent review cycle was completed on January 31, 2007.  These materials will be made available to the Vice President for Research and the Provost along with your evaluation so they may complete the full review process.    The Vice President for Research (or designee) will revi ew each Dean’s evaluations of their respective University Centers/Institutes and will make recommend ations on each Center or Institute’s continued operation .     VII. Guidelines for the Disbanding of Centers and Institutes       Disbanding a State of Florida Center or Institute  State of Florida Centers and Institutes shall be disbanded at the recommendation of the Council of Academic Vice Presidents and upon the approval of th e Board of Governors.  In the event that a disbanded Center/Institute has been funded by the Le gislature, the university must provide documentation to ensure that Legislative intent has been achieved and",
            "of Education and in requesting Legislative funding for the institute/center.    2. UF Centers and Institutes must be approved by th e relevant Dean(s), the relevant Vice President(s), the Vice President for Research, the Provost, and the President.  Because centers and institutes require a formal proposal process and review and approval by  the participating departments, the college and the offices of the Vice President for Research and Provost, only those entities that have gone through this process may call themselves a ‘center’ or ‘institute’.   Exceptions such as federal awards that require the naming of the activity as a \"Center\" should be discussed with the appropriate administrators.      J. Forms to apply for a center or institute can be obtained from the web at www.ir.ufl.edu/centers/guidelines.htm.       V. Guidelines for Submission of Annual Reports by Centers and Institutes:    The Office of Academic Affairs, the Vice President  for Research and the Florida Board of Governors require that all centers and institutes submit an annual activity report. When more than one university is affiliated with a center/institute, the host university is  responsible for submitting a comprehensive report.    A.  Annual Reporting requirements to the Florida BOG (for All Centers /Institutes)      An annual report (July 1 through June 30) is to be subm itted for each Center/Institute.  All reports are to be filed electronically through the Florida Board of Gove rnor’s (BOG’s) Expertnet system at the end of each calendar year for the previous fiscal year.  The annual reports will be coordinated through the University of Florida’s Office of Institutional Planning and Research.  Each Center/Institute will be issued a username and  password to enable the updating of information.     1.  Directory Information and Mission and Areas of Focus    a. Provide the name of the institute/center. Provide the name and title of the director, the address, telephone number, SUNCOM number, fax number, e-mail address, and web site address for the institute/center.  b. Indicate the Type of institute/center.  c. Indicate the academic discipline(s), by 5-digit Cl assification of Instructional Program (ClP) code(s), most closely affiliated with the center/institute.  d. Provide a list of all universities that are affiliated with the center/institute.  e. Provide a brief mission statement for the institute/center (75 words or less).  f. Identify key terms/phrases that indicate the major",
            "sanctioned center or institute is an extension of the University.  It requires some degree of oversight to maintain mission concurrence within the organization. State of Florida Centers (receiving state funds) require Florida Board Of Education (FBO E) approval since state funds are expended by the Center.           B. The center/institute should be closely tied to the research and educational mission and, when possible, to the strategic plan of UF (http://www.president.ufl.edu/workPlan.html).   Proposals for new centers and institutes must facilitate the academic mission of UF by enhancing its teaching and research functions, fostering external fund raising, and/or facilitating interdisciplinary cooperation.  These activities should be facilitated in ways that a current structure (department or college or existing center) cannot.  In particular, UF expects that a proposal for a new center or institute will demonstrate how it will enhance UF’s mission in a manner not being accomplished by existing programs.   1. The director must provide leadership and guidance for the direction of the research and facilitate interaction among faculty, staff and students. He/she should seek effective means of communication and collaboration, create an efficient organizational structure, and work to identify funds to sustain and expand upon the center's activities. The director is expected to be the primary contact between the center and the reporting authority. The director for a new center will be considered acting until officially appointed by the reporting official (dean or vice president).   2. The functions of the advisory committee will vary according to the mission of the center/institute, needs of the director and the requirements of the unit to which the center reports.   3. Large centers that involve several colleges and departments should form an executive committee of the involved chairmen and/or deans; in certain cases, outside advisory groups are desirable. The roles that these committees will play should be clearly specified in the proposal.    The proposal should be no more than 10 pages in length. Appendix material may be provided as specified. The following information should be included in the text of the proposal:  C.   Mission Statement and Goals: The mission of th e center should be defined and the goals for research, teaching and public service explained. All three elemen ts are not required for a center to be established but should be identified",
            "for the institute/center (75 words or less).  f. Identify key terms/phrases that indicate the major areas of focus for the center/institute. These terms will be used as identifiers in a searchable database.    2.  Staffing and Budget Information   a. Provide actual expenditures, number of positions, a nd rate for the prior fiscal year.  (Separate position and budget data should be submitted for each university when more than one university is affiliated with an center/institute).   b. Provide estimated expenditures, number of positio ns, and rate for the next fiscal year. (Separate  position and budget data should be submitted for each university when more than one university is affiliated with an center/institute).     B.  Additional Reporting Guidelines for State of Florida Centers /Institutes  In addition to the information submitted through the Expertnet system to the Florida BOG, in general annual reports for State of Florida Centers /Institutes must include the following information:    1. Mission and Areas of Focus for the Center/Institute  Summary of how the Center/Institute coordinates in tra- and/or inter-institutional research, service, and training activities that supplement and extend existi ng departmental instruction, research, and service  programs--that is, how the institute/center allows facu lty/staff/students to do what they could not do solely in a departmental or divisional setting.    2. Activities - Prior Year  Provide an evaluation of accomplishments related to th e prior year's goals and any recommendations that emanated from a review of the Center/Institute. Includ e an overview of the prior year's research, service, and/or teaching and training activities. Attach any supporting documentation (e.g., scholarly activities and  published research by primary authors, external funding sources, non-funded outreach, conferences).  Note: Goals/Activity information should be included fo r each university when more than one university is affiliated with an center/institute.      3. Activities - Coming Year  Provide a statement of proposed goals and activities for the next fiscal year--for example, proposed research and scholarly activities; teaching and training activities; service and outreach; internal (e.g., with departments, colleges, or other university units) or external networking (e.g., with other universities, community colleges, public schools; public-private partnerships); opportunities for students (e.g., assistantships,"

Position Data  Provide an organizational chart that delineates the f unctions of all faculty and staff and includes any advisory boards. Provide a list of current advisory board members. Also provide copies of relevant governance documents.  For proposals involving more th an one institution, include such information for each participating institution as well as giving the Statewide structure.     Annual Reports for the State of Florida Centers/Institut es should be sent to the appropriate State agency with a copy to the Office of Institutional Planning and Research.    C.  Additional Reporting Requirements for University of Florida Centers/Institutes   In addition to the information submitted through the Expe rtnet system to the BOG, UF Centers /Institutes are required to provide annual reports as required by the Dean  of the College to whom they report.  The format and information required for these reports are specified by the Deans of the respective colleges.     VI. Guidelines for Evaluation of Centers and Institutes     The University administration will evaluate Centers/Institutes on a cyclical basis.  The Provost and Vice President for Research will evaluate each State of Fl orida Center/Institute every three (3) years.  Deans will evaluate the University of Florida Centers/Institutes assigned to their respective colleges every five (5) years.      The submission DEADLINE for all evaluations will be approximately April 15 of each year.  The Office of Institutional Planning and Research maintain s the schedule of evaluations of all Centers and Institutes, and will coordinate the process with the r espective deans and the office of the Vice President for Research.

Because centers and institutes require a formal proposal process and review and approval by  the participating departments, the college and the offices of the Vice President for Research and Provost, only those entities that have gone through this process may call themselves a ‘center’ or ‘institute’.   Exceptions such as federal awards that require the naming of the activity as a \"Center\" should be discussed with the appropriate administrators.      J. Forms to apply for a center or institute can be obtained from the web at www.ir.ufl.edu/centers/guidelines.htm.       V. Guidelines for Submission of Annual Reports by Centers and Institutes:    The Office of Academic Affairs, the Vice President  for Research and the Florida Board of Governors require that all centers and institutes submit an annual activity report.

Proposed Activities: Describe the activities that are planned for the center (e.g., collaborative research on the topic of (X); the intent to generate interdisciplinary resources, to design courses, to develop an interdisciplinary graduate program, attract postdoctora l fellows, create a lecture series; to establish a core service facility, provide greater focus and depth to a r esearch area, etc.). Explain the plans to apply for external funding and identify the relationship of the center's activities with those of departments and/or other centers.

Describe, where possible, the synergistic and collaborative efforts existing amongst the members of the  proposed center.  Also describe their record in successfully garnering extramural funds.     E.   Reporting Structure: The proposal for a new cente r or institute must include a reporting structure and describe the logic of that structure at UF.  In particular, the proposal should outline to whom and through whom the center or institute reports.  The proposal s hould demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment and interest from relevant departments, colleges, or other stakeholders.     A new center or institute will in general, report to the dean of the college unless it is a campus-wide center or institute in which case it would report to th e relevant Vice President (Vice President Health Affairs, Vice President IFAS, Vice President for Research or the Provost ).  Any campus-wide centers should be discussed with the relevant vice president(s) prior to producing a proposal.  F.   Administrative structure: The position of the cente r/institute within the University/college/department must be explained with the lines of accountability and responsibility clearly indicated. Each center should design its own administrative structure in consultatio n with the relevant department chair(s) and dean. However, it is expected that each center/institute will have at a minimum, a director and an advisory committee.       4.
